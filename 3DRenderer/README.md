Requirements:
	[x] Deferred rendering
	[ ] Shadow mapping
	[ ] Level of detail using tessellation
	[x] OBJ-parser
	[ ] Frustum culling using a quadtree/octree
	[ ] Dynamic cubic environment mapping
	[ ] GPU-based billboarded particle system (rain)


Shader Flags:
   Shader Inputlayout
0b 0000  | 0000       : Deferred shaders | pos normal tex

Light types
0 : spotlight
1 : directional Light


TODO (Polish)
- Create an input class for main (camera movement)
- Optimize OBJ parser
- Create a Timer class
- Move DrawTargets into the renderer
- Remove all braches in render loop during release mode
- Remove gbuffer and instead load directly into the arrays

TODO (now):
- Create light UAV with structured buffer
- Create spotlight
- Create directional light
- add light to scene
- phong lighting for every light for each compute shader
